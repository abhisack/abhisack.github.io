Codefeed is collection of feeds of blog and sites every front-end developers follows.
Infact, I was buliding this project for my own use to get everything, every post of the blogs I follow at one place. I found that many people followed the blogs I did(A list apart, CSS-Tricks etc.). So I thought why not open source it if other might find it useful.
