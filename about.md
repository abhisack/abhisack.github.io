Hi there! I'm Abhishek Sachan, 16 years old Front-end Developer and Designer from India. I code, game and [tweet](https://twitter.com/AbhishekSachan3) and I'm most of the time up with my laptop making creative things for web. Most of my day passes checking and making pens on [codepen](http://codepen.io/ahisack) and learning as much as I can about Javascript & SVG. <br/><br/> I love bringing imaginations live on screen. I aim at working for developers to be able to contribute to the web industry but I also love working with clients and delivering them more that they demand.  I wanna keep learning and teaching others(through blogs and sites like this) about Front-end web continuously so that I can enhance my own skills and help others learn code. Web apps and technologies excite me and I love combining technology with design. Infact that's what makes me one of the biggest fans of Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>

My mentors of Web Industry are Sara, Chris Coyeir, Brad Frost, Lea Veroue, Anna Debenham and everyone whose blogs I read.
