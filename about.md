Hi there! I'm Abhishek Sachan, 16 years old front-end dev. I code, game and [tweet](https://twitter.com/AbhishekSachan3) and I'm most of the time up with my laptop making creative things of front-end web. Most of my day passes checking and making pens on [codepen](http://codepen.io/ahisack) and learning as much as I can about javascript & svg. SVG is the thing I'm still beginner at. sAnd yeah! I forgot to tell one thing, I'm a gamer too. <br/><br/> When I'm free from everything; gaming is my next thing. To let you know more about me, let me tell you, I'm big fan of [Anna Debenhm](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham), [Sara Souiedan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) and [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) and [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou). One can call them my role models. <br/><br/> I'm extremely fond of a quote said by a girl on Twitter: "On a good day I make the web look awesome; On a bad day I make it suck less."

###About Site
This site is currently built on Jekyll which previously was built on Wordpress. I wanted only content based blog and I guess DB was useless for me when I just have to share articles with minimal data.
