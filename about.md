Hi there! I'm Abhishek Sachan, 16 years old front-end dev. I code, game and [tweet](https://twitter.com/AbhishekSachan3) and I'm most of the time up with my laptop making creative things of front-end web. Most of my day passes checking and making pens on [codepen](http://codepen.io/ahisack) and learning as more as I can about javascript & svg. SVG is the thing I'm still beginner at.

To let you know more about me, let me tell you, I'm big fan of [Anna Debenhm](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham), [Sara Souiedan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) and [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) and [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou). One can call them my role models.
