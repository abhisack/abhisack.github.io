Chris Coyier explains in his recent [post](https://css-tricks.com/the-priority-navigation-pattern/) why you may not want to hide all nav links on small screens. It's very likely that you'd intend to toggle less important nav links but show the most important ones. Here's my demo on his excellent idea. I used 'nth-child' selectors with the very popular, checkbox hack.
