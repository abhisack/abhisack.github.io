Its an good idea to start developing with Bootstrap  if you're willing to work as user but if you wanna go with development you should really say no to it. There are many reasons for that. I've been myself  using that for 2 years. You may be  shocked to know, It gave me nothing. I just got few ideas of creating buttons, dropdowns, progress bar that too with the help of my previous knowledge.

There are various reasons why you should not use Bootstrap-

###Makes You Dependent on it

Yes, If you wish to use Bootstrap; believe us you'll not like to sit hours for creating your designs right from your mind. You'll better prefer to use Bootstrap classes to insert buttons, navigations , forms etc. What it will do is that it will not enhance your own talent. OK! your friend will praise you, your admirers will too you but as a developer did you learn anything? You didn't.. With it, , you're just limited to few type of designs over which you cant apply your own CSS.

###Limited Features

Although, people call it the most convenient way to create awesome themes (perhaps it is but is limited). You might have seen many Bootstrap themes but Did you notice that they all nearly kook same. At first you'll be very happy with it but later it 'll get boring when you'll see same designs every time.


And a lots more...
