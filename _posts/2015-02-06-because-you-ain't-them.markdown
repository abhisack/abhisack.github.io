Because it's about your interests it's about the time too but the most important thing is that it's about your soul. 
What you feel is right even if you're wrong because you just wanna follow your passion and not let your dreams 
shroud into darkness because you don't know the rules made previously as you are busy creating new ones that will 
replace the olds in terms of better humanity & relief. You cannot call unsatisfactory work your success because 
it's not. Your mind ain't storehouse of information. You've gotta be thinker, creative and there's only single way 
to do so is to follow your dreams; the biggest ones; the ones that please you a lot. 

###Get Out of The Fuss

A lot of fuss used to be everywhere because you were doing what others asked you to. Did you ever think 
beyond the rules? Nope you didn't because you think they're more experienced than you but have you ever 
known the truth of their real soul. They might not have been what you are. Remember you're a unique piece of 
creation with unique skills. You may not know what others do, Others may not know what you do. In one or 
other way uniqueness is always there in you because you're afterall universe's creation. 


And if it's about them; they say so because they didn't follow their passion and are even not known to the 
pleasure one gets following it. They just want you to repeat the same path they travelled on, being unaware of the 
fact that thereâ€™re unlimited paths, they want you travel on theirs. Oh! THEY are successful? They must probably 
be criers behind the back or the jealous ones to distract you!
REMEMBER It's YOU, not a bit of THEM.
