Hello World! Welcome to my blog. This is my personal blog where I'll be sharing my front-end stuff,, tutorials and my life as well. Stay tuned for more.

###Why I created This Blog

This is obivious for you to think why did I even createa blog? The reason is simple. I just wanted to show t the people what I know.
Before I had blog, I coded a lot of things in HTML, CSS, JS and other languages. No day passed when I didn't code for 3 hours at least. On a holiday I coded 9-10 hours(now it's more than that) but shared nothing with the world. And I think something is half its value if it isn't shared with the world. I just thought I should teach others with the knowledge I have. I believe on "learn & teach". I love telling others what I know.

Apart from that, second reson is that there's a lot about me that nobody other than me knows and I guess there was no better place than a blog "best among the best friends". With my best friends I can share a lot of opinions but not all of 'em or just say nt what  can with my blog. Som blog is gonna be my right hand now. Here's where I'll be posting tools and fron-end stuff I'd create in future.
Stay connected to know more about me and my interests.
