I've been into front-end web development for quite a time now and I'm instantly learning, finding new challenges to fulfil. I'm in love with coding and had along ago decided to make my career in it. Sometimes being involved in making the things for web to learn more and more makes others worry about my future, and I get scolded just because I code more than I do anything including studies and sleeping. Sometimes I feel bad that my work isn't being values by the people around me(not on the web). But, ultimately, that doesn't stop me. Instead, it pushes me to work harder, learn more & more and feel special and proud of what I do. The best way is to keep doing what you love and have faith in without letting anyone stop you. They can't be my enemy just because they are criticizing me but I'll become my own enemy if I stop just because they want me to. Let them express their views, let your side be even stronger.

Great people inspire everyone. Recently the very great human, a scientist, a thinkerer, the person know as 'Missile Man of India', Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed away. His simplicity, his way of rising from nothing to everything has always inspired me. He was one of my role modal in my childhood like most of the children in India but I didn't ever bother learning deeply about him. But after his passing away, I read quite much about him which inspired me to work harder and harder and made me full of a few thought of him- "Look at the sky how clear everything is, Only those are blessed who wrok hard", "If you want to shine like the sun; first, you've to burn like it". He was also ciriticized in the beginning but he kept on loving science and working on his projects endlessely and when he died he was persuing his passion, lecturing students, spreading knowledge. He died leaving a lot of peope as lover and almost none has hater of him. This truth has ignited a kind of revolution in me to be simpler and work harder for this life is too short to learn much and too long to learn nothing.
